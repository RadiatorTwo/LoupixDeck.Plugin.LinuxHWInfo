/// framebuffer in one call (<c>IRenderCanvas.DrawPixels</c>, ~4 µs under the host's render lock).
/// An older host has no such member, so the frame is sent as rectangles there: horizontal runs of
/// one color, merged downwards while the run below is identical. A rectangle on whole-pixel
/// coordinates covers each pixel fully, so the host's anti-aliased fill still lands exactly
/// (measured: 0 differing pixels, ~300 rectangles and ~0.2 ms for a full page). Both paths leave
/// transparent pixels alone, which is what the transparent mode relies on.
